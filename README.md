This is a support ticket from Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. This ticket ensures that if someone views the source code of this page they will see semantic HTML elements used, and that they follow a logical and sequential positioning within the HTML document. The image and icons will now have alt attributes to signify alternate messages to display if images can't load, or other scenarios were the alt attribute would be appropriate. The website now also has a title to descirbe the page users will be viewing, and searching for in their browser, instead of "title". All links now have their appropriate ID's assigned, and are functioning as a user would intend them to. All necessary notes for changes and additions to the stylesheet are noted within the sheet, and classes function as intended.

The above sources were used along with the inspect element to identify incorrect div element usage and replace them with the approriate, semantic elements. These sources were also used to ensure this support ticket follows best practices and solves the customers ticket. No code has been copied.
